```stub
append hello world to readme file using the echo command
```

You can append "Hello World" to a readme file using the `echo` command in the terminal. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
echo "Hello World" >> README.md
```

This command will append the string "Hello World" to the end of the `README.md` file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.

```stub
append 0000 to the readme.md file using the echo command
```

You can append "0000" to the end of a file named "readme" using the `echo` command in a Unix-like operating system. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
echo "0000" >> readme
```

This command will append the string "0000" to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.

Please note that you need to have write permissions to the file and the directory it's in to be able to do this. If you don't, you might need to use `sudo`:

```bash
sudo echo "0000" >> readme
```

However, this might not work as expected because the redirection (`>>`) might be performed by your shell before `sudo` is invoked. In this case, you can use `tee`:

```bash
echo "0000" | sudo tee -a readme
```

The `-a` option tells `tee` to append to the file, rather than overwriting it.
